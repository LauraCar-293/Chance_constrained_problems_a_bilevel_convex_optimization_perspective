# Contents of the code:

In this code I have programmed functions to solve the four optimization problems used as examples in my thesis 
with the several algorithms proposed.

## Structure

The first part of the notebook consist of each problem solved for an scpecific seed.
In the second part I define some loops to solve the problem. In each iteration I create a different sample from the random variable and solve the optimization problem.
